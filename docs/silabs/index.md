# About Silicon Labs Matter

Silicon Labs provides two paths for development. 

1. **Simplicity Studio**: Users may also develop within Simplicity Studio using the Silicon Labs Matter GSDK Extension. Instructions on using the extension and tools within Simplicity Studio are included both in this documentation and in the [Simplicity Studio v5 Developer's Guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/latest/ss-5-users-guide-overview/). The tag **[SIMPLICITY STUDIO]** is used to denote documentation that is specific to the Simplicity Studio developer experience.
2. **GitHub**: Users may develop their applications directly out of the [*Silicon Labs Matter GitHub repo](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter) by cloning the repo and following instructions in this documentation specifically related to Github based development. Instructions are also provided for using VSCode in the included developers guides. The tag **[GITHUB]** is used to denote documentation that is specific to the GitHub developer experience.

While much of the setup for development is the same, there are differences in the development flow specifically around writing, and compiling sample applications. This documentation calls out instructions that are specific to each use case.
